# Introduction
In a much similar fashion to the previous assignments in this course, we were given another opportunity to put into practice: the knowledge we have been acquiring throughout our lectures. We were expected to install and use a reliability growth assessment tool we chose The Covariate Software Failure and Reliability Assessment Tool (C-SFRAT). This is an open source application which applies covariate software reliability models.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 
3 plots for MTTFmin, twice and half of it for your test data

A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of RDC

# Comparison of Results Between Reliablity and RDC Testing


# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques




# How the team work/effort was divided and managed



# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
Our team had a very challenging time at first trying to learn and set up the functionality of the C-SFRAT testing environment. We found it difficult at first to know how to complete the model ranking. We overcame this challenge by going through the "A covariate software tool to guide test activity allocation" link provided on the assignment sheet which provided a lot of direction on how to generate the graphs.


# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
It would have been helpful to have some more detailed instructions about how to use Software Reliability and Testing Analysis Tools, as well as having a tool which is able to run on every type of computer.
